# 428: Shibuya Scramble - Text Speed Patch

Change the rate at which text is displayed in the PC version of [428: Shibuya Scramble](https://vndb.org/v1299)

The files can be found in [Releases](https://github.com/arsym-dev/428-Text-Speed-Patch/releases).

## Usage

1. Go to your game folder, probably something like:

    ```C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\428_shibuya_scramble_en```
 
2. Back up the original exe
 
3. Extract the exe with the desired text speed (2x or instant) and rename it to:

    ```428 Shibuya Scramble.exe```
 
4. Run and enjoy
 
 
## Issues
Instant doesn't play very nice with some things, like:
- Text doesn't appear instantly in the backlog
- Text that plays without waiting for user input will instantly vanish (just re-read in the backlog)
- Text that cuts close to the end of the page or overflows to a new page will move on to the new page automatically (just re-read in the backlog)
 
It's not perfect, but I hope it improves the experience somewhat
